# Kusto Syntax Highlighting Extension for Visual Studio 2017 and 2019

This extension provides syntax highlighting for Kusto .csl and .kusto files
in Visual Studio using a slightly modified version of the TextMate grammar
file from Kuskus (https://github.com/rosshamish/kuskus/).

Note that there is no language server here, it's just the syntax highlighting.
